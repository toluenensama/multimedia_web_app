    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate photographer with a love for capturing moments in time. 
        My journey into photography started years ago, and since then, I have been dedicated to honing my craft.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through my lens, I strive to tell stories, evoke emotions, and showcase the beauty of the world around us. 
        Whether it's a breathtaking landscape, a candid portrait, or the intricate details of everyday life, 
        I believe every picture has a unique narrative.
